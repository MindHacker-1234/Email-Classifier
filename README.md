# Email-Classifier
Our email system utilizes a sophisticated email classifier to ensure your inbox remains free from unwanted messages. This intelligent system analyzes incoming emails for a variety of elements:

Text: The classifier scans the email body for keywords, phrases, and writing styles commonly associated with spam.

By learning from pre-classified emails stored in dedicated "ham" and "spam" folders, the classifier continuously refines its ability to distinguish legitimate messages from unwanted ones. This two-folder approach, combined with the multi-element analysis, ensures a high level of accuracy in protecting your inbox.
